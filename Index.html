            "They have one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom, with a bite force of over 3,700 pounds per square inch.",
            "Crocodiles can swim at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour in short bursts, thanks to their powerful tails.",
            "Their eyes have a special membrane that allows them to see clearly underwater while keeping their eyes protected.",
            "Crocodiles communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including hissing, growling, and even bellowing.",
            "Unlike many reptiles, female crocodiles exhibit parental care, guarding their nests and helping hatchlings reach the water.",
            "They are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish, birds, and mammals, but they can also consume fruit on occasion.",
            "Crocodiles are found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, inhabiting rivers, lakes, and wetlands.",
            "In the wild, crocodiles can live for 70 to 100 years, with some individuals in captivity living even longer."
